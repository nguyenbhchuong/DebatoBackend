# DebatoBackend

## Overview

DebatoBackend is a backend application designed to handle authentication and other core services for the Debato platform. It is built using NestJS, MongoDB.

## Folder Structure

- **src/auth/**: Contains all authentication-related modules, services, controllers, and strategies.
  - **auth.module.ts**: Main module file for the authentication feature.
  - **controllers/**: Handles incoming requests and returns responses.
  - **services/**: Contains business logic for authentication.
  - **google.strategy.ts**: Implements Google OAuth strategy.
  - **auth.payload.d.ts**: Defines TypeScript types for authentication payloads.
  - **jwt.strategy.ts**: Implements JWT strategy for token handling.
  - **jwt.config.ts**: Configuration settings for JWT.
  - **dto/**: Data Transfer Objects for defining data shapes.
  - **schemas/**: Schema definitions for validation or database models.

## Authentication

- The JWT token is now stored in an HTTPOnly cookie named 'jwt'
- The cookie is:
  - HTTPOnly (can't be accessed by JavaScript)
  - Secure in production (only sent over HTTPS)
  - SameSite=Lax (provides CSRF protection while allowing normal navigation)
  - Expires in 1 day
  -
